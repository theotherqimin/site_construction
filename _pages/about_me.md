Studies suggest that the way in which we describe ourselves changes qualitatively as we grow up. Younger children tend to describe themselves with a focus on things that are more concrete, such as physical characteristics or hobbies. The older we get, the more we focus on psychological states and the perceptions of others. 

So eight-year-old me would like you to know that I have two brothers and my favourite colour is purple (to be honest, I don't think it is but someone wanted to guess my favourite colour once upon a time and I thought they could use a win that day so when they said, 'it's purple', I said, 'how did you know?') I like walking in random forests (shoutout to machine learning), but I have a tendency to get lost in them because I have a terrible sense of direction (fun fact: the picture above is one I took in a forest that I got lost in. I got rescued by a lovely couple â€” see 'Charlie'). I like circus acts and magic tricks but not clowns. I broke my right arm when I was seven, and (forgive my sins) I really really like spoilers. 

Those things are actually all true of current me as well. I should probably just add that I'm currently studying a MSc in Social Data Science at Oxford University. So if you're open to having a circus act/magic trick-watching, spoiler-loving, has a slightly weaker right arm and poor sense of direction but is pretty good at teaching (see teaching experience in CV) and doing data analysis person to join your team, then please feel free to get in touch using any of the links at the left of this site. Otherwise, thanks for swinging by!
