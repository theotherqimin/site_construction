Hi, I'm Qi Min. <br><br>
It's pronounced like 'chee', except without the 'h' sound. <br>
If that doesn't help, try making the 'tsk' sound first â€” the one you make to express disappointment. <br>
That's probably what my parents were going for. <br>
If all else fails then generally, if you make loud enough noises at me, I will give you some attention. <br>
